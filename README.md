To optimize and visualize coffee sales performance through a dynamic dashboard, providing a clear overview of total sales, key customers, and relevant trends. To achieve this, I performed data cleaning and preparation to ensure quality and consistency. I then utilized Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to facilitate interactive data exploration. Finally, I designed an interactive dashboard that allows for the analysis of total sales over time, the application of dynamic filters by coffee type (Dark, Light, Medium), the identification of the top 5 customers, performance analysis by packaging size, sales segmentation based on loyalty programs, and visualization of sales by country to identify market opportunities.
